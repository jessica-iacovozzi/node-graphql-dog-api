        "description": "In spite of their elegant appearance, Afghans were bred to hunt. They are aloof, haughty dogs around strangers, but can be loving, playful companions in the home. With their gorgeous, high-maintenance coats and their regal manner, these dogs could be considered the \"super-models\" of the canine world.",
        "history": "Afghan Hounds were originally employed as hunters and guardians in their native Afghanistan and their lineage pre-dates our modern breeds. Returning British army officers took sighthounds from Afghanistan, India, and Iran home with them in the early 1900s. The most famous dog, which set the breed standard, was Zardin, imported from India in 1907. In the 1920s, two types were imported to UK and formed the basis for breed development there. The Afghan arrived in the U.S. in 1922, with breeding kennels established on the East Coast. Zeppo Marx, youngest of the Marx brothers, famously imported two Afghans in 1931.",
        "funFact": "Afghans' silky coats are extremely high maintenance.",
        "health": "Afghans are prone to cataracts and often suffer from the lung disease chylothorax. They can also be sensitive to anesthesia.",

This short-coated, medium-sized dog is well muscled, can be of any color, and occasionally shows a ridgeback.",
        "history": "Traditional African dogs arrived in Egypt around 4700 BCE from the Levant. The Egyptians bred them to be swift and slender, and they continued there for centuries in isolation, eventually migrating to southern Africa. As time passed, they likely bred with the dogs of traders or seafarers until the current type was achieved. Their Swahili name, Umbwa Wa Ki-Shenzi, means common or mongrel.",
        "funFact": "Reportedly, these dogs can become grumpy as they grow older.",

They resemble the Greyhound, but come in two coat varieties—smooth and rough, and are accepted in all coat colors. This breed is gentle, calm, and affectionate with children and makes a wonderful family dog, especially in rural environments with lots of open space. Staghounds may not be suitable for homes with smaller, furry pets, which they may see as prey. They are seldom territorial, so don't make the best watchdogs.",
        "history": "The American Staghound resulted from settlers crossing Scottish deerhounds and Greyhounds, and both are still occasionally introduced to enrich the breed. The modern version likely traces back to the 1800s; General George Armstrong Custer used them to hunt on the American plains.",
        "funFact": "Staghounds are very fast but are not hyperactive.",

They are aloof and haughty with strangers, but become very emotionally attached to their families. Their hunting instincts make them some danger to smaller animals; they will possibly give chase if they see them running.",
        "history": "This breed originated from the pariah dogs of Sub-Saharan Africa—also called bush dogs or basenji—and it is also closely related to the Sloughi of the Maghreb. Despite morphological similarities, mitochondrial DNA evidence shows that it is only very distantly related to other sighthounds. They are relatively uncommon in Europe and North America, but there is a growing band of devotees.",

        "description": "This deer-like, primitive Central African breed was once used to track lions. These unique, playful dogs form strong bonds of loyalty with their owners and families. They are inquisitive and extremely playful, and are often noted for their excellent problem-solving abilities. Basenjis are called \"barkless dogs,\" but they definitely do communicate—through a range of chortles, yodels, and barroos. They are also known for being very clean, almost odorless dogs—another primitive trait.",
        "history": "Recent genetic testing has revealed that these are among the oldest type dog in the world—likely descended from Asian wolf crosses—making them an important link to ancient canine history. Similar dogs are seen on many Egyptian stelae, sitting at the feet of royalty. Their name means \"wild dog from the bush,\" as it was in the remote bushlands of Africa's Congo Basin that they developed their unique characteristics. The breed was not discovered by Europeans until the nineteenth century. Two dogs were exhibited at Crufts in London in 1895, but tragically both died from distemper. Basenjis arrived in the U.S. in 1937, and the AKC recognized them in 1944.",

While outwardly lithe and graceful, they are also surprisingly strong and tenacious. These were wolf hunters, after all. Generally they have calm, friendly temperaments, though they can be stubborn and require competent, experienced owners.",
        "history": "These elegant dogs, also known as Russian Wolfhounds, were originally bred for hunting wolves and hares in Russia. The breed is believed to have developed through cross-breeding ancient sighthounds, such as the Saluki, with heavier native Russian dogs. Some of the earliest references to \"hare-coursing dogs\" date back to the year 1260 at the court of the Grand Duke of Novgorod. There are also records of a special breeding station for these sighthounds at the Imperial Czar's kennels in Gatchina that date back to 1613. The breed was first imported to the United States in 1888, and was registered by the AKC in 1891. By this date, the breed had also become popular in the UK, due to the influence of Kathleen, Duchess of Newcastle, who had established a breeding kennel that produced a number of champion dogs.",

The modern Canaans share many qualities of other primitive dogs, including a strong survival instinct. They will bark at strangers, making them good watchdogs, but they are not aggressive. This breed is good with children, enjoys active family life, and excels at competitions like obedience, showmanship, agility, flyball, tracking, and herding.",
        "history": "This early dog was used by the Israelites to guard their camps and herd their livestock. Excavations of an ancient dog cemetery in Ashkelon, Israel, unearthed 700 dog skeletons, all of them anatomically similar to the modern Canaan dog. Canaan Dogs were unknown in the West until 1934, when Austrian animal behaviorist Rudolphina Menzel began training them as guard dogs for the Israeli Defence Forces.",

        "history": "Carolina Dogs were originally Native American dogs and were the first domesticated canines of the Americas, thought to be direct descendants of the ancient pariah dogs that accompanied Asians across the Bering Strait land bridge 8,000 years ago. In the 1970s this same dog was discovered roaming wooded areas of the Deep South by Dr. I. Lehr Brisbin, Jr., a senior research ecologist at the University of Georgia's Savannah River Ecology Lab. It was he who named them. The remoteness of their home area allowed the dogs to develop naturally, with little influence from other breeds.",
