With their gorgeous, high-maintenance coats and their regal manner, these dogs could be considered the \"super-models\" of the canine world.",
        "history": "Afghan Hounds were originally employed as hunters and guardians in their native Afghanistan and their lineage pre-dates our modern breeds. Returning British army officers took sighthounds from Afghanistan, India, and Iran home with them in the early 1900s. The most famous dog, which set the breed standard, was Zardin, imported from India in 1907. In the 1920s, two types were imported to UK and formed the basis for breed development there. The Afghan arrived in the U.S. in 1922, with breeding kennels established on the East Coast. Zeppo Marx, youngest of the Marx brothers, famously imported two Afghans in 1931.",

The breed was not discovered by Europeans until the nineteenth century. Two dogs were exhibited at Crufts in London in 1895, but tragically both died from distemper.

Some of the earliest references to \"hare-coursing dogs\" date back to the year 1260 at the court of the Grand Duke of Novgorod. There are also records of a special breeding station for these sighthounds at the Imperial Czar's kennels in Gatchina that date back to 1613. The breed was first imported to the United States in 1888, and was registered by the AKC in 1891.

These findings, combined with historical evidence, has led some to conclude that the breed actually originated in south-eastern England approximately 2,000-2,500 years ago. Hare coursing with Greyhounds became popular in England in the sixteenth century, and at the same time, the first of the breed arrived in the Americas with the Spanish conquistadors.

        "commonNames": ["Pye-dog"],
        "description": "One of the earliest primitive breeds, the Indian Pariah evolved in the outskirts of towns and villages, close to forests where tigers and leopards were common. As a result, this is a highly cautious breed that makes an excellent watchdog. They can also be territorial in defense of their pack or family. The term pariah can mean outcast, but in the canine sense it refers to a primitive class of dog that is not formally recognized or commercially bred.",
        "history": "The Indian Pariah Dog (Canis lupus familiaris) is thought to trace back 15,000 years, making it one of the oldest canine lineages in the world. It is the aboriginal land-race, meaning naturally selected dog, of the Indian sub-continent, which includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Nepal. The modern-day Pariah Dog resembles the fossil remains of many early dogs from around the world, and may also be the progenitor of the Australian Dingo.",

        "description": "The tallest of the hound breeds, the Irish Wolfhound can be a real couch potato and loves nothing better than to lie around in the most comfortable spot. These dogs have superb temperaments, are calm when indoors, and are generally easygoing, making them excellent pets for people who can give them occasional space to roam.",
        "history": "Irish Wolfhounds may have been brought to Ireland as far back as 7000 BCE; they were highly valued since Roman times as guardians, hunters, and companions. Despite their even temperaments, Irish Wolfhounds were known for being ferocious and fearless, and were used to hunt wolves and guard livestock. The coat of arms of early Irish kings bore an image of the Irish Wolfhound and the words \"Gentle when stroked, fierce when provoked.\" Nearly extinct by the late 1800s, the breed was recreated from the few remaining specimens by Scotsman Captain George Augustus Graham.",
        "funFact": "Wolfhound puppies initially grow very quickly and will be large by six months of age.",

These are playful, lively little dogs that thrive on attention and they make charming companion animals for mature adults. They are not advised for families with children, however; these dogs are fragile and can be injured if handled too roughly.",
        "history": "These svelte little dogs originated more than 2,000 years ago in the regions now known as Greece and Turkey. Depictions on Egyptian tombs and from ancient Rome show petite Greyhound-like dogs that were the ancestors of the modern Italian Greyhound. Although they were undoubtedly bred as pets, the breed was likely also used in vermin control. By the sixteenth century they had made their way to England— and were also found in aristocratic homes throughout Europe.",

These are agile, graceful dogs that resemble a slimmed-down, elongated Doberman Pinscher. They are often shy, but can be counted on to defend their homes and families. Kannis are also known as a silent breed that does not bark needlessly. At home with their families they are faithful and easy to train, but can be independent-minded.",
        "history": "This rare breed of sighthound was traditionally given as a gift by a bride to her groom as part of her dowry; kanni translates as \"maiden\" or \"virgin\" in the classical language Tamil. The dogs are still highly prized by families and still given as gifts, never bought or sold, and only if the recipient promises to take great care with the dog. They are fed a diet of milk and corn porridge, and only get meat once a week or so. Although this beloved breed is near extinction, no group has come forward to save it.",

These dogs should be elegant but rugged, with a body longer than it is tall, and a relatively heavy bone structure. They should also be able to handle rough terrain and show stamina and endurance. In the home, these tireless hunters are affectionate and docile, well-behaved with children, other dogs, and, with proper introduction, even cats.",
        "history": "The lineage of the Magyar Agár, also called the Hungarian Greyhound, stretches back more than 1,100 years. These dogs were first bred to accompany hunters on horseback and are; therefore, capable of traveling long distances at steady speeds. Traditionally, these sighthounds were owned by the nobility, although the working classes kept smaller versions of the dog, known as farm Agárs or hare catchers, which unfortunately no longer exist.",

This Indian sighthound is above all a working dog, capable of bringing down anything from small game, likes hares; to larger game, like antelope. They are elegant, graceful, and courageous, hunting over taxing terrain that most dogs would find daunting. In the home they are loyal but can be aloof. Their two chief requirements are plenty of space and lots of exercise.",
        "history": "The Mudhol Hound is an ancient breed that was introduced to western India from central Asia and Arabia, making it a likely descendent of the Saluki or Tazi. It's possible they were brought to India by the Pathans, Afghans, Arabs, and Persians through the famous Kyber Pass. These dogs were known to travel with nomadic peoples and to follow their caravans from one place to another. The breed name comes from the town of Mudhol, where the dogs are popular.",
